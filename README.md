# Lab 08 Quotes - OO Design and GSON
## Setup
* Create a new repository for this partnered lab; call it quotes. In that repo, add a .gitignore file from the course repo, and then run gradle init --type java-application.
## Feature Tasks
* Use the file recentquotes.json to show random popular book quotes.
* Your program should use GSON to parse the .json file.
* In the build.gradle put this in the dependecies: { implementation 'com.google.code.gson:gson:2.9.0'}
* To check if the Gson is working type in Gson gson = new Gson(); into the App class.
* The app needs no functionality other than showing the quote and the author when it is run. The app should choose one quote each time it is run.
* Ensure that you can test your code by running ./gradlew test.

# Lab 09
## Overview
* Today you’ll update your lab from yesterday: rather than using a hardcoded file of JSON data with quotes, you’ll grab quotes from an API and display those to the user.
* write the quote to offline.json file
